 Adobe Acrobat PDF Files
AdobeÂ® Portable Document Format (PDF) is a universal file format that preserves all
of the fonts, formatting, colours and graphics of any source document, regardless of

the application and platform used to create it.
Recipients of other file formats sometimes can't open files because they
don't have the applications used to create the documents.
